Test task for an intership at Nokia

### To build a project, you need to use the cmake utility:
First you need to create a folder in which all the necessary files will be stored and go there:<br/>

    mkdir <folder-name>
    cd <folder-name>

Then, to perform the build, you need to run the following command:<br/>
    
    cmake [options] -S <path-to-source> -B <path-to-build>
    
To change the generator for a specific platform, you can use the command:<br/>
    
    cmake [options] -G <generator-name> -S <path-to-source> -B <path-to-build>

### To run the program, run the following command:

    <name-exe-file> <name-csv-file>
